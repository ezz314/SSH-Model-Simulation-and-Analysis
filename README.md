# SSH-Model-Simulation-and-Analysis
This project explores the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a one-dimensional tight-binding model that exhibits topological edge states under certain conditions. The analysis includes constructing the Hamiltonian, visualizing eigenstates, and studying energy bands and Berry connections.
